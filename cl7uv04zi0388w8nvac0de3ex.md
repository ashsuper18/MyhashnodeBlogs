## 100 Days of Code Challenge

## Hi everyone,
I have joined the #100DaysofCode challenge in Python and I am updating my daily progress on Twitter
You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ashsuper18) for daily updates. 

You can follow by blogs for weekly reports which I am going to upload, like what i have learned in last week and tricks and tips which i can share.

#### For example 
I have learned about github and VS Code where we can connect both. 
Here we can push directly from VSCode to Github without coding . 
Here is mine [github](https://github.com/ashsuper18) so you guys can check how I am uploading my daily code on [github](https://github.com/ashsuper18).
